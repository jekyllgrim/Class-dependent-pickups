## Description

ZScript-based class-dependent pickups for GZDoom. The `ClassDependentPickup` class allows defining pickups that will look like different items and will give different items depending on the player's playerclass. **It's compatible with multiplayer**: the item will still look like and give different items to different players, but once one player picks it up, it'll disappear for everyone.
